<hr>
<p>Hello, <br>
  <br>
  If you are viewing this you are probably very special to me! I am just beginning my journey of learning to code.<br />
Over the last 7 years, I have worked hard to finish school. Over the last 2 years, I have worked hard to gain work experience.<br />
Now, my journey begins - working even harder teaching myself how to program.<br />
I am truly excited about this journey and, though it will take more work than my previous journeys, it will also be even more rewarding.<br />
Assuming you are my family (because you are reading this) I promise to repay your generosity and kindness to me. <br />
Once I am a professional programmer, we will go on very special vacation, my treat!</p>

<p>To those who do not know me, my name is Dena, and I graduated with my Masters in Organization, Learning, and Technology. <br>
I currently work in the legal field and contemplated going to law school. Unfortuneately, I do not think law is the right field for me or a very healthy field in general. <br>
Out of confusion and desperation, I became crazy enough to, for the first time, actually consider learning to code as an option for me. <br>
Then, once I began, I realized I loved it. Coding allows me to be creative and will open many opportunities to make a positive impact on the world. <br>
If I can suceed in being a self-taught programmer, anyone with discipline and dedication can as well! <br>
Here is to my journey and we will see where it takes me.</p>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
Dena
